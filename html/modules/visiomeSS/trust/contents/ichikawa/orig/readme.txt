Purpose of the model:
   AMPA receptor channel current in cerebellar Purkinje cell is modified according
   to the induction of long-term depression. The change in the AMPA receptor
   channel current is observed in its peak value instead of the time to peak
   or decay constant. The purpose of this model is to find which kinetic parameter
   is most responsible for the observed change in the AMPA receptor channel current.

Description of the model:
   AMPA receptor channel (AMPAR) binds two glutamate molecules, and two glutamate
   -bound state of AMPAR makes transition to the open state. A, A.glu, A.2glu, and
   A* show AMPAR, one glutamate-bound AMPAR, two glutamate-bound AMPAR , and open
   AMPAR, respectively (Fig.1). 
   (fig1.jpg)
   AMPAR makes transition to the desensitized states by the prolonged application
   of glutamate. Ad.glu, Ad.2glu, and Ad* are desensitized states of A.glu, A.2glu,
   and A*, respectively. No desensitized state for non-glutamate-bound AMPAR (A)
   is assumed in this model. Rate constants are calculated partially from the reported
   literature. The rest of the parameter values are selected to fit the simulated
   AMPAR current with the experimentally observed AMPAR current.
   An example of simulated AMPAR is shown in Fig.2.
   (fig2.jpg)
   Black and red line in Fig.2 show time courses for glutamate and open state of AMPAR,
   respectively. The time course of glutamate seems to be single exponential because of
   the slow reaction of AMPAR in comparison to the change in the glutamate concentration.
   If you want to see the rising phase of glutamate, you can select shorter full scale
   for time axis and simulate on your own computer.

How to run:
  1) This package is run by A-Cell, which was developed by Kazuhisa Ichikawa,
     FujiXerox, Co., Ltd. More information about A-Cell can be obtained at the following site:
          http://www.fujixerox.co.jp/crc/cng/A-Cell/index.html
     A brief explanation for installation and using A-Cell will be found in the above
     site. If you want to get A-Cell installation package, you should write e-mail to
     A-Cell@fujixerox.co.jp.
     You will get A-Cell by free after resistration as an A-Cell user.

  2) After you get the A-Cell installation package, install A-Cell following the instruction
     which is found in readme.txt.

  3) Copy the "Purkinje_AMPA_receptor.Csim" file in this package to any directory you want.

  4) Run A-Cell by cricking the A-Cell icon.

  5) Open "Purkinje_AMPA_receptor.Csim", and you will find the same graphics as is shown in Fig.1.

  6) Simulate the model by using "Online simulation" capability of A-Cell, or generating
     stand-alone C program automatically generated by A-Cell using "generate differntal
     equations" icon on A-Cell.
