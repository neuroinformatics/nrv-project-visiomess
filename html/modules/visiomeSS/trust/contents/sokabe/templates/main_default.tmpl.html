<h4>MODEL</h4>
<p>
Software: Ajuste 95.<br />
Description: The "Ajuste 95" is a software that can calculate ion currents
from energy profiles and energy profiles from ion currents in multibarrier,
multisite, multioccupancy channel model (See reference 1 for detail).

<h4>How to run</h4>
<p>
Based on the inferred structure of the channel, we inferred the channel has
two binding sites. Furthermore, electrophysiological data strongly suggest
this is a one-ion channel. Therefore, a three energy barriers two binding
sites (3B2S) model of Eyring rate theory with one ion occupancy (one-ion
channel) is applied to calculate energy profiles of ions. To reduce the
uncertainty of the model, sets of experimental data under different ionic
conditions were used to get the model parameters. These data include I-V
data at both symmetrical (5, 10, 50, 100, 200 and 500 mM [ K+]) and biionic
(10, 50, 100, 500 mM [ K+/Na+] as well as 50, 500 mM [K+/Li+]) conditions
according to Alvarez, et. al. (1992). The values for electrical distances
of energy barriers and energy wells were not pre-set, but were adjusted
gradually as long as the symmetrical energy profile was ensured.
Optimization of the parameters underwent several steps. First, energetic
parameters (energy values at peaks, G1, G2, G3, and wells, U1, U2) for each
ion were varied with fixed symmetrical distance parameters. Next, the
distance parameters and energetic parameters were optimized simultaneously.
Then, the distance parameters (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, L1, L2) were fixed at
new values, and the energetic parameters were reoptimized. These steps were
repeated several times until the SUMSQ, the weighted sum of squared
differences of experimental and theoretical data, was minimized. The final
results are shown in the following table and figure. The electric distance
of the binding site, D = D1 + D2, is 0.054 for monovalent cations.

<h3>Ion Channel</h3>
<p>
We measured single channel properties of an artificial ion channel. The
permeability ratio between K+ and Na+ keeps constant under various biionic
solutions, suggesting that the channel has a one-ion channel property. To
correlate the structure and function of the channel, we built energy
profiles for ions permeation through the channel according to 3B2S model of
Eyring's theory. The fitting parameters are shown in the table.

<h3>Single Ion Channel</h3> 
<p>
We measured single channel currents of an artificial ion channel (AC164)
reconstituted in lipid bilayers. The permeability ratio between K+ and Na+
keeps constant under various biionic solutions, suggesting that the channel
has a one-ion channel property. To correlate the structure and function of
the channel, we built energy profiles for ions permeation through the
channel according to 3B2S model of Eyring's rate theory.
