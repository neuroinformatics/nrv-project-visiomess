Original Report? Persistent Na+ Current and Ca2+ Current Boost Graded Depolarization of Rat Retinal Amacrine Cells in Culture, J Neurophysiol. (in press)

Synopsis:
We investigated the contribution of voltage-gated currents on membrane depolarization by using rat GABAergic amacrine cells in culture recorded by the patch clamp method. Under the voltage clamp, we identified a transient Na+ current (fast INa), a TTX-sensitive persistent Na+ current (INaP) and three types of Ca2+ currents (ICa), L-, N- and the R-type.

About data:
DATA.zip file contains three ascii format data files, which show the current-voltage relationships of isolated INaP, fast INa, and ICa recorded by whole cell patch clamp method in the cultured amacrine cell.

Column A: Command voltages at which the cell was voltage-clamped.(mV)
Column B: Current amplitudes recorded. (A)
Column C: SEMs of the current amplitudes. (A)

<INaP.csv> The average current-voltage relationship of INaP. n=12.
<fastINa.csv> The average current-voltage relationship of fast INa. n=12.
<Ca.csv> The average current-voltage relationship of ICa. n=9.
